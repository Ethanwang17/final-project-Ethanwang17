**Domain of Interest: Health**

**Why are you interested in the field/domain?**

We are interested in areas of health because it can characteristics of healthy individuals as well as their lifestyles. Health is currently one of the more relevant topics since we are in the midst of a pandemic. We want to explore trends of diseases beyond covid such as physical and mental health ie heart failures and stress. If possible, we can also compare different diets between different countries to identify correlations.

**Datasets:**

[Heart Failure Prediction | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) - This dataset is from Kaggle. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. This dataset is made to help people with CVD help patients know if they have Cardiovascular disease before it’s too late. Data was collected by combining 5 different datasets which were Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, Stalog (Heart) Data Set. In total there are 918 observations and 12 features in the dataset. This dataset can help answer our question about how

[Mental Health in the Tech Industry | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry) - This dataset is from Kaggle. This data was collected by Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) by using survey data from the year 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. This database contains 3 tables: survey, question, and answer.  When looking at the answers dataset there are a total of 236,898 rows and 4 columns. Within the questions dataset there are 105 rows and 2 columns. Lastly, for the survey dataset there are a total of 5 rows and 2 columns. With the information that this database provides, we are future able to analyze the question of what is frequency of mental health disorders in a tech workspace.

[COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset) - This dataset is from Kaggle however the data used is composed from data collected by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), the PRB (Population Reference Bureau), John Hopkins CSSE (Center for Systems Science and Engineering), and the USDA Center. There are 170 rows and 32 columns in all 5 files that show different data such as food, fat, and protein supply and quantity. With the data from this dataset, we can further explore how different diet aspects affect health and deaths among different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
